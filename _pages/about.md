I am Eric, the youngest of 3 brothers living in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. I have 8 years of experience in software development, beginning my career with COBOL and later transitioning to web development with Php and Laravel. Recently, I have developed a keen interest in game development using Unity and aspire to become an indie game developer.

Apart from my work, I spend a lot of time playing PC games ranging from popular AAA titles like Overwatch 2 and Elden Ring to indie games like Stardew Valley and Eastward. I am also a magic enthusiast as I enjoy the art of it. I also enjoy performing close-up magic tricks to entertain the people around me.
